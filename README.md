# monero-verify
A Linux (Bash) shell script to automatically download and verify Monero binary releases.  The monero-verify script downloads binaries, PGP keys and hashes from multiple sources for redundancy to protect against active (MiTM) attackers. 

This shell script is currently a WIP.  I expect it'll be buggy when I post the first alpha release.
